Hereâ€™s a basic Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print "Hello, World!" to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Explanation:

public class HelloWorld: This defines a class named HelloWorld.

public static void main(String[] args): This is the main method where the program starts. Every Java program must have a main method.

System.out.println("Hello, World!");: This prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.


To run this program:

1. Save it in a file called HelloWorld.java.


2. Compile it using the command: javac HelloWorld.java.


3. Run it with: java HelloWorld.
